Documentation of Joy-It Car platform
====================================

.. caution::
   This documentation website is still in development

**Robotics-JoyCar** GitHub repository contains documentations of the Joy-It Car platform used for labworks and projects of students.

The GitHub repository of this project : `Robotics JoyCar <https://github.com/IOGS-LEnsE/robotics-joycar>`_

|

This platform was initialy designed by **Joy-It** to work with a *Micro:bit* microcontroller board that can be programed in *MicroPython*.

You will find more informations about the original Joy-It Car platform on the `JoyCar website <https://joycar.joy-it.net/en/>`_.

Embedded electronics teached at **Institut d'Optique** for future photonics engineers is based on Nucleo board, including *STMicroelectronics* STM32 microcontrollers. 
A complete version of drivers for MBED-6 operating system is still in development.

About the LEnsE
---------------

The **Experimental Teaching Laboratory** (*LEnsE*, for *Laboratoire d’ENSeignement Expérimental*) is a major structure of the *Institut d'Optique* engineering school. It offers remarkably strong training that contributes 25% of the total curriculum. It is an impressive structure where students have access to a large diversity of material and human resources to be able to gain the skills to become excellent experimenters recognized in their field.
