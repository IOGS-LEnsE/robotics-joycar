Machine Vision Platform
=======================

Machine vision
--------------

**Machine vision** encompasses all industrial and non-industrial applications in which a **combination of hardware and software** provide operational guidance to devices in the execution of their functions based on the capture and processing of images.

For example, machine vision is used to inspect parts in a production chain without stopping the manufacturing flow. If defaults are detected on a part (wrong color, bad shape...), a sorting system can eject bad elements.

In manufacturing settings, machine vision systems required the following items:

#. **Lighting** to illuminate the scene to make the object features visible.
#. **Lens** to captures the image and delivers it to a sensor.
#. **Image sensor** to collect a digital image of the object.
#. **Computer** (or digital signal processor) to process the images and extract the required information.
